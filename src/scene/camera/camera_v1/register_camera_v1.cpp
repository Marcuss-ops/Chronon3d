// CAM-04/05 (DOC 03) — Per-job ownership enforcement.
//
// THIS FILE IS A NO-OP STUB BY DESIGN after the CAM-05 migration.
//
// Historical context: this translation unit previously hosted three
// `static` / global-state functions:
//
//   - `static CameraTransitionCatalog s_transition_catalog;`
//   - `const CameraTransitionCatalog& get_transition_catalog();`
//   - `void register_camera_v1_builtins();`
//
// These violated the CAM-05 per-job ownership rule (camera-plan DOC 03 §5, doc retired) because
// they froze the catalog during static initialization, then exposed a
// process-wide singleton that any `ShotTimelineResolver` could reach via
// a global lookup.  The `CameraTransitionCatalog` itself owns a
// `std::mutex mu_` that was being acquired on every transition lookup —
// a hot-path global lock during render-graph evaluation.
//
// The migration (CAM-05 PR1):
//   1. The catalog is now owned BY THE RENDER JOB (typically held inside
//      `RenderRuntime::m_owned_transition_catalog` or passed as an
//      explicit constructor argument to `ShotTimelineResolver`).
//   2. The bootstrap is `register_camera_v1_builtins_into(catalog)` below:
//      callers pass their own catalog reference, no global state involved.
//   3. The default transition implementations live as anonymous-namespace
//      `make_default_*()` factories in `shot_timeline.cpp`; they are an
//      internal implementation detail used by `CameraTransitionCatalog::
//      register_defaults()`. External callers (including unit tests) get
//      the built-ins through `register_camera_v1_builtins_into(catalog)`.
//
// Reference: docs/camera-plan/03-MOTION_TRAJECTORY_TIMELINE_DETERMINISM.md  // drift-class: historical (camera-plan design docs retired)
//            §5 (Per-job ownership enforcement).
